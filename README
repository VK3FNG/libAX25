AX25 Library
============

This library set is still really under test but is now release for
general use.

You are supposed to use glibc 2.1 (libc6 unstable libraries) for this
package.  I have attempted to cater for glibc 2.0 users here.

To compile this I used:
  * A Debian GNU/Linux system
  * autoconf 2.57
  * automake 1.5
  * libtool 1.4.3
  * libc 2.3.1
  * gcc 3.2.3

This library is copyright by the respective authors (see AUTHORS for a list)
and licensed under the GNU LGPL (see COPYING for more information).
