Installation Instructions for AX.25 Library
===========================================

To make this library you will need the following:
	glibc2.1 (Debian 2.1.1-5 or RedHat glibc-2.1.2-3)
	A Modern kernel (2.2.x)
	libtool

To build it you type:
	./configure
	make
	make install

If you want to put the files in the "normal" places, type:
	./configure --exec_prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
	make 
	make install
	
That will put the binaries in /usr/{s}bin and the config files in
/etc/ax25

If you want to install the example config files
	make installconf
